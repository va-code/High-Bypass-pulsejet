# High-Bypass-pulsejet
 Just a quick cad of a pulsejet idea

Attached is a cad file of the design. No resonance analysis has been performed on the shape so it will not likely function in its current state.
Because of the shape it should diffuse air to slightly increase operating pressures at the intake and accelerate more air than it take takes into the combustion chamber by drawing the air past the exhaust ports.
